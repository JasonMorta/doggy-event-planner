#  Software requirements

## System architecture
For this application I'll be using the create-react-app to develop my application.
The reason for going with react is, it has great support, create browser compatibility,
it can make use of reusable components, other web-packs and libraries like bootstrap.
React can also make use of Hooks, which allows a developer to create more advanced apps
with less code.

I Will make use of heroku to deploy my app. This app will also have a back-end server
with Express and Node that are supported by Heroku for deployment. Heroku offers free
deployment for any MERN stack applications.

I'll also make use of React-bootstrap for styling my app. Bootstrap has a wide range
of reusable components that's already styled, is supported on the latest browser and
is mobile responsive. Using bootstrap will cut down a lot of development time.
